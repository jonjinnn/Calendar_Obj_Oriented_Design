# Calendar_Obj_Oriented_Design

Create an object-oriented design for a software implementation of a Calendar application. 

1. The Calendars app must support the Gregorian calendar.
2. Each calendar in the Calendars app can have different sets of events that a user can set
hours and minutes for, including starting and ending times.
3. An event can be made repeatable each week up until an end date. For example, an
event starting Jan. 1, 2022 can be set to repeat every week until Mar. 17, 2022.
4. A user can add, remove, and update events.
5. The Calendars app supports multiple users each of which may have multiple calendars.
6. Users can add, remove, and update individual calendars.
7. The Calendars app supports multiple time zones. Changing time zones for the app
automatically updates the time for events in a user's calendar.
8. The Calendars app provides users with a choice of a dark theme or light theme.
9. The Calendars app has a screen that allows a user to configure the app for a particular
time zone or change the app's theme (either dark or light).
10. The Calendars app allows users to create private and public calendars that can be
shared with other users. Users can toggle between making a calendar private or public.
Public calendars are available to all users of the Calendars app. Private calendars are
only viewable by the user that owns the calendar.
11. A user can share a calendar event with another user. Shared calendar events from a
private calendar can only be viewed by users to which the event has been shared.
12. Users can filter calendars they have created to allow viewing a subset of events they are
interested in.
13. The Calendars app visualizes a userâ€™s events for a single day, an entire week, an entire
month, or for the entire year.
